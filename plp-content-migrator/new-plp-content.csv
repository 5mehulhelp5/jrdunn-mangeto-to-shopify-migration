https://jrdunn.com/watches/breitling/superocean.html,Breitling Superocean watches,The New 2022 Superocean Collection. ,"The SuperOcean was originally designed and produced by Breitling for professional and military divers. The modern designs still embody the spirit of the watch born in 1957. Made of durable 316L stainless steel or black coated titanium, these dive watches are corrosion resistant to the harsh ocean waters. With variations of both men’s watches and women's watches, the SuperOcean offers great versatility. Whether you prefer a stainless steel bracelet or a rubber strap, this mechanical watch is perfect for daily wear. The rubber strap version of this watch with a folding clasp has a ratcheted extension feature. This feature allows you to easily adjust the length of the strap to fit over your scuba gear while scuba diving.","Title: Partners For a Cause
Description: Breitling has partnered with legendary surfer Kelly Slater’s brand OuterKnown and Econyl. The partnership between these companies has led to producing sustainable and recycled watch straps for the SuperOcean. These straps are made out of recycled, abandoned fishing nets that are being removed from the ocean. Not only are they stylish, but they’re helping to restore the beauty of the ocean with their product.

Title: Superocean Automatic 48
Description: Crafted in lightweight and durable Titanium, the Breitling Superocean Automatic 48 is a tool watch for safely exploring the seas. This is the largest watch in the Superocean range at 48mm. Equipped with a specially designed ceramic bezel with a safety lock. This allows the user to accurately time air consumption time or mission length.
All of the Superocean Automatic 48 incorporate superior antimagnetic systems that allow for consistent, accurate time telling. If you’re looking for something more understated and stealthy, a black DLC coated titanium version is also available. This watch is only available in strap versions.

Title: Breitling Superocean Automatic 46
Description: The Breitling Superocean 46 has been made in two different bezel versions; a red gold bezel or in all black titanium. The company has continued its stance on producing black titanium watches only on straps. This is due to the bracelet taking most of the wear and no coating has been developed to withstand scratching.

Title: Breitling Superocean Automatic 44 & Breitling Superocean 42
Description: The baseline model in the Superocean series is the Automatic 44 and Automatic 42. The dials of these watches have been simplified with easy to read enlarged index markers and arabic numerals. For underwater or night viewing, they are coated with superluminova. With just short exposure to light, they will stay illuminated in the dark for approximately an hour, though this can vary.
The core collection of superocean watches are very priced to be accessible. The price of the Superocean Automatic 44mm is $3700, while the Automatic 42mm is $3,450 on a rubber strap with a tang buckle. Other versions are available such as with a bracelet or OuterKnown econyl strap. The Automatic 44 offers a special edition OuterKnown version with a dark green bezel, dial and Econyl nato strap.

Title: Breitling Superocean Automatic 36
Description: The Automatic 36 is a much thinner and smaller diameter than other watches in this collection, measuring 36mm. This watch is available on a rubber strap, bracelet, or an after purchase addition of an Econyl strap. This women’s diver watch looks exactly like it’s larger counterparts but offers a unique dial and bezel choice. This size superocean is available with a white rubber bezel and dial, the epitome of a summer style. Offering a water resistance of 660 ft, this woman’s watch has plenty to offer for the open water."

https://jrdunn.com/watches/breitling/superocean-heritage.html,Breitling Superocean Heritage watches,,"Take on the seas without sacrificing elegance. The Superocean Heritage sets itself apart from other watches in its class of dive watch. This high precision, mechanical watch has been updated over the years to provide the high standards that Breitling expects out of it’s watches while keeping the style and design deeply tied to it’s 1950s origin There are a few variations of both millimeter and movement configuration that today’s Superocean Heritage is available in. The Breitling Superocean Heritage 42, a 42 mm three hand style of watch is perfect for those with slim wrists. There’s a slightly larger Breitling Superocean Heritage 44 Chronograph versions are a great midsize entry. Finally, there’s the Breitling Superocean Heritage 46, a 46mm classic three hand style that offers an oversized versionTake on the seas without sacrificing elegance. ","Title: Is the Breitling Superocean Heritage a good watch?
Description: Swiss watchmaking is often regarded as the finest quality and highest standards of horology through history. The Breitling Superocean Heritage embodies those same standards and the precision that is paired with that reputation. Within the range, there are four different movements used which are all officially certified Swiss chronometers.
All movements used by Breitling pass the certified chronometer standards but the B01 is the only movement manufactured in-house by Breitling. The B20 movement is a movement in the three-hand version of the Superocean Heritage, a collaboration with Tudor watches that brought to life, a partially in-house watch movement with a 70-hour power reserve. There’s also the heavily modified Swiss movement that uses an outsourced base for a separate chronograph version.
There’s a good way to tell whether the chronograph version features an in-house movement. When the sub-dials are located at 3, 6, and 9, the Superocean Heritage features a 100% manufactured movement. Another notable difference is the dual-colored dials of these watches, i.e., a blue dial with black subdials.
All Superocean Heritage watches are now fully equipped with a ceramic bezel which improves the wear of the timepiece. While good, the previous version with a painted steel bezel would often scratch when impacted by a sharp edge or fade over time. The bezel is still ratcheted for fail-safe use and now incorporates a luminescent marker at the arrow for easier reading.
The bracelet version of the timepiece is equipped with the Heritage bracelet. This unique bracelet is a mesh-style bracelet that brings to mind the classic “Milanese” bracelet. This version embodies a mature, cultured style that is not usually found in a dive watch. Beloved by Breitling fans, the Heritage bracelet hides almost all wear with its unique “braided” design.
The timepiece is also available on a water-resistant heritage-style rubber strap with a folding clasp which secures the watch to your wrist. If you don’t plan on going in the water and love the style but want to dress it up a bit you can pair it with a nice quality leather strap with either a tang buckle or folding clasp.
Whether you plan to use this watch under the ocean or on land, there’s so much to love about the Swiss-made Breitling Superocean Heritage."

Not every woman desires a diamond center stone and some look for a ring setting with sapphire and diamond combination. Sapphires are popular and durable enough to wear every day. Most people don’t know that they actually grow in every color of the rainbow! J.R. Dunn Jewelers’ award-winning in-house designer, Robert Pelliccia, has created spectacular blue sapphire diamond engagement rings.

For just a touch of sapphire with a timeless, vintage inspired design check out our designers Verragio, Tacori and Kirk Kara.

An engagement ring is meant to reflect not just her style but her as well, what better way to personalize it than with a gorgeous sapphire ring?

Are sapphires durable for everday?
Yes. Sapphires are graded as the next durable centerstone next to diamond, being graded at a 9 on the Mohs scale, a diamond being 10. While scratch resistant, just like diamonds if you are too hard on them they can get small abrasions or small chips, most commonly on the girdle (edge) or Table (top) of the gemstone. Diamond and blue sapphire rings are among the most safe to wear as an engagement ring.

Are sapphire engagement rings popular?
Not only are they popular, they are highly sought after. Many celebrities and famous political or royal figures can often be seen sporting one as their ring. The most popular pairing is a sapphire in the center with a round diamond on each side set in 14k white gold. For a truly authentic and old world feel, pair it in yellow gold for a beautiful contrast."

Description: Both the Chronomat and a jet fighter have something in common, both are high operating machines that require precision and power. In 1983, by request of the national Italian aerobatics team - the Frecce Tricolori - Breitling created the perfect timepiece to pair with their Aermacchi MB-339; the jet of their choice. The watch needed to be sturdy to hold up to the tight spirals and spiraling maneuvers made by the team in the sky. It needed to be easy to read so that with just a quick glance the pilot would be able to see the elapsed time. It had to be a chronograph watch with the ability to accurately and easily start and stop the chronograph function. It also needed the ability to grip the crown and adjust functions to match while wearing gloves. What Breitling created was the epitome of form and function. The watch delivered on all fronts and has become a familiar timepiece to see on jet fighter pilot’s wrists. The Chronomat is now made in various metal combinations such as stainless steel, stainless steel and 18k gold and all 18k gold versions. Although previously known as a pilot watch, the Breitling Chronomat 44 brings style, elegance and performance to outmatch any task you need to accomplish.

Description: Drawing its inspiration from the World War II era, the Aviator 8 pays tribute to the onboard clocks in the cockpits found in the fighters and bombers during the time. Why the 8? It pays homage to the french word “Huit” which referenced the power reserve of the cockpit instruments and Breitling’s HUIT Aviation Department. Something to be aware of is that in 2019 Breitling rebranded the Navitimer 8 to the Aviator 8. So if you’re here looking for the Navitimer 8 Automatic, it is the same watch. The Navitimer 8 B01 Chronograph is now named the Aviator 8 B01 chronograph respectively."
